"""Python mirror of contracts/market-core/src/math.rs.

Kept in lockstep with the Rust module by hand (both are short and
self-contained) and exercised by the property tests at the bottom of this
file, which run with no dependencies beyond the standard library:

    python3 model/fpmm_model.py

This is also where the off-chain inverse for "sell N shares" lives
(`gross_for_shares` / `collateral_out_for_shares`). The contract now exposes
an exact-share entrypoint (`sell_shares`), backed by `calc_sell_shares` in
math.rs, which this module mirrors bit-for-bit. The older `gross_for_shares`
helpers are kept for backward compatibility but are deprecated in favour of
`calc_sell_shares`. `agents/core` ports both to TypeScript (BigInt) for the
trading agent; all three must agree with this model.

Conventions match math.rs: all amounts are non-negative ints in collateral
base units (whatever `decimals()` the collateral token reports, 0..=18).
Rounding always favours the pool.
