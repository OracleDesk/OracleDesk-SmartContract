# ADR 0001: Resolution commitment on `create_market`

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

The original `market-core` design let a market's creator wire up a resolution
rule (a Reflector price threshold, or an m-of-n signer set) *after* the market
was already open and trading. That is a real economic exploit: a creator can
watch how the market trades, see which outcome the crowd is pricing in, and
only then pick (or quietly negotiate) a resolution rule tailored to a
different, more profitable outcome. Nothing on chain stopped this — the
resolver's `configure_price` / `configure_signers` were plain admin-gated
setters with no link back to the market itself.

## Decision

`Market` (and `create_market`) now carries a `resolution_hash: BytesN<32>` —
a commitment fixed at creation time, before any trading happens. It is the
sha256 of an XDR-encoded `resolver::ResolutionSpec` (an enum wrapping either a
`PriceConfig` or a `SignerConfig`; see `contracts/resolver/src/lib.rs`).

The resolver's `register_price_spec` / `register_signer_spec` accept the
*revealed* spec at any time after creation, recompute its hash, and only
accept it if that hash equals the market's `resolution_hash` and no spec has
been registered yet (`Error::SpecHashMismatch`, `Error::MarketAlreadyConfigured`).
Because the check is purely cryptographic, these functions have **no admin
gate** — anyone may reveal the spec, since only the party who already knows a
hash-matching preimage (the creator, at the time they committed to it) can
produce one that passes.

The two resolution rules are wrapped in one `ResolutionSpec` enum before
hashing (not hashed as bare `PriceConfig`/`SignerConfig` values) so the two
modes sit in disjoint hash spaces even if their field encodings could
otherwise collide.

## Consequences

- A market's resolution rule is fixed before the first trade. Front-running
  the resolution mechanism is no longer possible.
- Creating a market now requires computing this hash off-chain first (the
  agent's trace-building code does this — see `agents/core`), then revealing
  the spec once trading is ready to close. Markets with a never-revealed spec
  are simply unresolvable through the normal path; `Resolver::guardian_void_market`
  (admin-gated) exists as the escape hatch for that case.
- `Outcome`/`PriceConfig`/`SignerConfig` used inside `ResolutionSpec` must stay
  stable in field order and naming: XDR encoding is structural, so reordering
  fields changes the hash of every already-committed market's spec type.
